        The great tit, known for its distinct features including a black head and neck, prominent
        white cheeks, olive upperparts, and yellow underparts, exhibits slight variations across its
        numerous subspecies.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> formally documented
        this bird under its current scientific name in the 1758 edition of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae">Systema Naturae.</a>
        It belongs to the tit family Paridae and is a small passerine bird. Found widely across
        Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and extending eastward across the Palearctic to the
        Amur River, and southward into parts of North Africa, it typically resides in various
        woodland habitats. Most great tits are sedentary, only migrating during severe winters.

          The great tit, similar to other tit species, nests in cavities, typically within tree
          holes. According to the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) (2023),
          <q
            >They nest between April and June, usually producing one brood annually with clutches of
            up to nine eggs that are incubated for approximately 14 days.</q
          >
          Their nests are vulnerable to raids by woodpeckers, squirrels, and weasels, and may also
          suffer from flea infestations.
          <br /><br />Juveniles disperse from their parent's territory but typically do not travel
          far and the adults are preyed upon by sparrowhawks. The great tit has successfully adapted
          to human-altered environments and is a familiar sight in urban parks and gardens.
          <br /><br />It generally does not migrate, with pairs typically remaining within or near
          their territories year-round, even in the northernmost parts of their range.<br /><br />During
          the summer, it primarily feeds on insects and spiders gleaned from foliage, with larger
          invertebrate prey including cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets, bees, wasps, snails, and
          woodlice. In winter, its diet expands to include a wider range of food items, such as
          small hibernating bats. And also the great tit is a significant species for
          <em>ornithological</em> studies due to it is wide distribution and adaptability to diverse
          habitats.

          The great tit is widely distributed throughout Eurasia, spanning from Europe (excluding
          Iceland and northern Scandinavia) to Mediterranean islands, North Africa (Morocco,
          Algeria, Tunisia), the Middle East, and parts of Central and northern Asia. <br /><br />It
          inhabits a variety of ecosystems including open deciduous woodland, mixed forests, forest
          edges, and gardens. In denser forests, it prefers clearings, while in Siberia it resides
          in boreal taiga. Across its range, it can also be found in oak forests, Atlas cedar
          stands, palm groves in North Africa, and riverine willow and birch forests in eastern
          Siberia, Mongolia, and China. <br /><br />The Turkestan subspecies occupies riverine
          woodlands, low scrubland, and oases, adapting to habitats from dense forests to open areas
          with scattered trees at higher altitudes.

        approximately 40 distinct types of calls and songs. While the calls are generally similar
        between males and females, males are significantly more vocal compared to females, who
        rarely call. <br />Soft single notes like <u>"pit"</u>, <u>"spick"</u>, or
        <u>"chit"</u> serve as contact calls. An emphatic <u>"tink"</u> is employed by adult males
        in alarming situations or during territorial disputes. One of its most recognizable calls is
        the <u>"teacher, teacher"</u> phrase, often described as resembling the sound of a squeaky
        wheelbarrow wheel, used to assert ownership of territory. <br /><br />It is said amongst

        <br />Males are distinguished by their vibrant plumage, featuring a black bib that runs down
        the belly, bordered by a lemon-yellow breast. The color of the male bird's chest has been
        associated with the quality of his sperm, being a way in which he demonstrates his
        reproductive superiority over females. <br /><br />Higher levels of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenoid"> carotenoids</a> intensify the yellow
        tone of the breast and strengthen sperm's ability to resist the damaging effects of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)">free radicals</a>. Females and
        juveniles look similar but have unexciting colors. In these birds, the black line down the
        belly is also narrower and sometimes discontinuous.
