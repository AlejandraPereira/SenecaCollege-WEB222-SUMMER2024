            <h4>Harry Potter has been orphaned and lives in the house of his abominable 
                uncles and unbearable cousin Dudley. Harry feels very sad and alone, until 
                one day he receives a letter that will change his life forever. In it they
                inform him that he has been accepted as a student at Hogwarts School of Magic. 
                From that moment on, Harry's luck takes a spectacular turn. In that very special
                school he will learn incantations, fabulous tricks and defense tactics against evil
                arts. He will become the school champion of Quidditch, a type of aerial football played 
                on broomsticks, and will make a handful of good friends... but also some fearsome enemies. 
                But, above all, he will know the secrets that will allow him to fulfill his destiny. Well, 
                although he may not seem like it at first glance, Harry is not an ordinary boy: he is a real 
                wizard!.</h4>
