            <h4>"Happy 53rd birthday, doctor. Welcome to the first day of your death." â€œI belong to some moment in your past. 
            You ruined my life. I may not know how, why or when, but you did it. You filled all my moments with disaster and 
            adness. I ruined my life. And now I am determined to ruin yours." When Dr. Frederick Starks, a psychoanalyst with 
            a long career behind him, receives this mysterious and disturbing anonymous message, his tranquility and predictable 
            life falls apart. Starks will have to use all his cunning and speed to, in fifteen days, find out who is the author
            of the massive threat that promises to make his existence impossible. If he does not succeed, he must choose between
            committing suicide or witnessing how, one after another, his family, friends and acquaintances are being murdered by
            a psychopath who promises to carry out the plan he has devised to take revenge to the end. Giving an unexpected twist
            to the relationship between doctor and patient, John Katzenbach offers us a fascinating novel that connects with the 
            tradition of the best psychological suspense.</h4>
