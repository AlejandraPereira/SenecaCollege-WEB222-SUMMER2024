            <h3>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer 
                of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to 
                complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.
                Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity’s notes and outlines, 
                hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn’t expect to uncover in the chaotic 
                office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of 
                bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of the night her family was forever altered.
                Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents could devastate the already 
                grieving father. But as Lowen’s feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could 
                benefit if he were to read his wife’s words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, 
                a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue loving her.</h3>
